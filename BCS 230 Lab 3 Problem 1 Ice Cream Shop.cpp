/**
	Stanley has an ice	cream shop in Tampa, FL. His most popular ice cream flavors are
	chocolate and vanilla. Usually, the shop sells three cone sizes;
	• small(9oz)			-	cost	$2.75,
	• medium 12oz)			-	cost	$3.25,
	• and large (15oz)		-	cost	$3.75.

	Write a menu-Driven program that will make the ice-cream shop operational.
	Your program should allow the user to do the following:
        a) Buy ice cream in any	size/flavor and	in any number of cones.
        b) At any time show the total number of	orders of each size sold.
        c) At anytime show the total number of ice cream sold.
        d) At any time show the total money made.

	Your program should consist of at least the following functions:
        • a	function to show the user how to use the program,
        • a	function to sell ice-cream,
        • a function to	show the number	of cones of each size sold,
        • a	function to show the total amount of ice-cream sold, and
        • a	function to show the total money made.
	Your program should not use any	global variables and special values such as ice cream
	cones sizes and cost of each must be declared as named constants.
